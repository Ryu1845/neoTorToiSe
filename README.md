# neoTorToiSe
Redesigning TorToiSe

Maybe change the name since it won't be that close 

Consider RWKV

Better LLM using all the new tricks (GQA, XPos, ...) 

Maybe replace attention (Hyena, other SSM stuff, ...)

Maybe use audio SSL for speech embedding, or maybe use a discrete codec like encodec and such (kinda like the original tortoise did)

Only use a GAN from the last hidden layer (like the one in knn-vc) (Vocos?)
